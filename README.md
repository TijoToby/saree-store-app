#  SareeStore – Java Swing E-Commerce Application  

##  Project Overview  
SareeStore is a **desktop-based e-commerce application** built using **Java Swing** and **MySQL**.  
The project simulates an online saree shopping platform where users can register, log in, view saree products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout.  

The system also includes an optional **Admin Module** to manage products and orders.  
This project demonstrates the concepts of **GUI design, event handling, database connectivity (JDBC), and MVC architecture**.
